# Type Alias: CliError

> **CliError** = `InstanceType`\<*typeof* [`CliError`](../variables/CliError.md)\>

Defined in: node\_modules/@black-flag/core/dist/src/error.d.ts:83

Represents a CLI-specific error with suggested exit code and other
properties. As `CliError` has built-in support for cause chaining, this class
can be used as a simple wrapper around other errors.
